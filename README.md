## Dependencies

This application uses Ruby on Rails. To install the dependencies, you can use the following command:

```bash
bundle install
```

To start the Rails server in development mode, you can use the following command:

```bash
./bin/dev
```

This will start the Rails server on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Ruby Version

See the `.ruby-version` file for the current Ruby version.

Install the correct Ruby version using your preferred Ruby version manager. For example, using [rvm](https://rvm.io/) or [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv):

## Testing

This application uses RSpec for testing. To run the test suite, you can use the following command:

To create the database, run the migrations and seed ðŸŒ± you can use the following commands:

```bash
bundle exec rails db:create
bundle exec rails db:migrate
bundle exec rails db:seed
```

## Redis

To install Redis on macOS, you can use Homebrew:

```bash
brew install redis
```

To start & stop the Redis service, you can use the following commands:


```bash
brew services start redis
brew services stop redis
```

## Sidekiq

This application uses Sidekiq for background job processing. To start the Sidekiq
service, you can use the following command:
